Official implementation of "Bridging the Domain Gap: A Simple Domain Matching Method for Reference-based Image Super-Resolution in Remote Sensing (GRSL 2023)"
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15944.pdf) | [Project Page](#)
## Overview
We propose a simple but effective domain matching method for reference-based image super-resolution (RefSR) that works well even when there is a large domain gap between input and reference images. Our method consists of three key components:

1. Gray Matching - Reduces domain gap in correspondence matching
2. Whitening and Coloring Transform (WCT) - Aligns feature distributions 
3. Phase Replacement (PR) - Preserves structural information

## Features
- Plug-and-play domain matching modules for existing RefSR models
- No additional training required
- Significant performance improvements on real-world remote sensing data
- Easy integration with SOTA RefSR models like C2-Matching, AMSA, and DATSR

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/domain-matching-refsr.git
cd domain-matching-refsr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
We use the RRSSRD dataset which contains paired electro-optical satellite images:
- HR images: Gaofen-2, WorldView, Microsoft Virtual Earth 2018
- Reference images: Google Earth
- 4,047 training pairs (480Ã—480)

## Usage

```python
# Example usage with DATSR model
from models.datsr import DATSR
from models.domain_matching import DomainMatching

# Initialize models
datsr = DATSR()
dm = DomainMatching()

# Load images
lr = load_image('lr.png')
ref = load_image('ref.png')

# Apply domain matching
lr_gray, ref_gray = dm.gray_matching(lr, ref)
matched_features = dm.wct_matching(lr_gray, ref_gray)
sr = datsr(lr, matched_features)
```
